# Concept

## Requirements

### Logging

- Log time spend with a live timer or manual input
- Each log needs a date and time spent and at least one tag
- Each log can have a description, picture, key takeaways, location
- Give each log tags so you can later filter them by tags e.g. #learning, #git, #coding. This allows for a more detailed and dynamic overview of your time spent on each areas

### Areas

- You can define areas where you want to improve
- You can set goals / milestones for each areas
- An area is under the hood is should probably be a tag
- Set checkin reminders

### Stats

- Have a overview of your time spent on each tag per week, month, year

## How to work

- Recursive outline filling
